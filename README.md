# emoji + pixellate = emojillate

Here's a thing that you (yes, YOU!) can use to make emoji pixels out of an image! You didn't even know you needed this! You did! 

The emojilated image is just text so you can copy it and send it to everyone you know. Or upload it to a gist. Or both. Whose world is it? It's yours, it's yours. Emojillate away!

## How to Emojillate

Just upload an image on the [website] (http://meowni.ca/emojillate/) and emojilate away!

- You can hide the background (or not!)
- You can also change the resolution of the emoji pixels
- You can copy the emojillated image (it's actually just text!) or upload it to a gist. A GIST.
